# AI Agents with LangGraph

In this repository, I am going to learn how to make **AI Agents** using **LangGraph**.

## ðŸ“Œ Overview
This repo will document my learning journey with LangGraph â€” from the basics to building functional AI agents.  
LangGraph allows you to design, manage, and orchestrate agent workflows in a graph-based structure, making it easier to create multi-step reasoning systems.

## ðŸš€ Goals
- Understand the fundamentals of LangGraph.
- Learn how to create and connect AI agent nodes.
- Explore integration with LLMs and APIs.
- Build end-to-end agent workflows.

## ðŸ“‚ Structure
- **/notebooks** â†’ Jupyter notebooks with hands-on code.
- **/examples** â†’ Example agent workflows.
- **/docs** â†’ Notes and references.

## ðŸ›  Tech Stack
- **LangGraph**
- **Python**
- **Jupyter Notebook**
- **OpenAI / other LLM APIs**

## ðŸ“… Progress
I will update this README as I learn more and add practical examples.
