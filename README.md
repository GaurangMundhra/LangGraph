## About LangGraph

LangGraph enables the creation of AI agents and workflows by defining nodes and edges in a graph, making reasoning and multi-step tasks modular and scalable. This repository contains practical notebooks, example workflows, and documentation to help understand and implement LangGraph projects.

## Key Learnings So Far

- Understood the basics of LangGraph’s graph-based workflow design for AI agents.
- Built modular agent workflows using nodes and edges for reasoning steps.
- Integrated large language models (LLMs) and APIs to enhance agent capabilities.
- Learned the importance of organizing code and documentation for reproducibility.
- Experimented with practical examples and documented the process for future reference.
